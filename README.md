Karel Farm Final Project Specifications

Mission: Write an OOP (object oriented programing) style program to simulate a farm. A successful program will:
Work correctly
Be documented properly with comments including Java-Doc (pre & post)
Will follow the specifications given...youâ€™re not hired to improve this!

Critical Objects
Farmer - The farmer owns the farm and their main task is to choreograph all the activities on the farm. A good farmer is outstanding in their field, so they leave their house to stand in the middle of the field to be planted & harvested. They go home once the work is done.
Planter - The planter collects seed delivered by the Coop and plants the field. Then parks back in the Planter shed
Harvester - Harvests the field, delivers it to the Coop Collection site and then parks back in the Harvester Shed.
Coop - Collects the specified seed order from the seed bin, delivers it to the Coop Collection site and returns to the Coop Shed. The Coop will return once the Farmer requests a harvest pickup. The Coop will collect the harvest and deliver it to the harvest bin, then return to the Coop Shed.
